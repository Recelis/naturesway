                Quality drinking water is an oft-misunderstood concept. When it exists, it is unappreciated, 
                and when it doesn’t, you panic. But in the middle of this spectrum is the not-very fine line of 
                <a href = "link http://www.unwater.org/water-facts/water-sanitation-and-hygiene">
                2.1 billion people who lack access to safely managed drinking water services</a>. The 340,000 annual 
                worldwide child mortality rate from diarrhoeal diseases and the up to 5% GDP of lost productivity 
                time in many countries”. 
            </p>
            <p class = "info">
                In our opinion, 2.1 billion is too low of an estimate as it mainly focuses on water 
                <a href = https://washdata.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/2017-07/JMP-2017-tr-smdw.pdf>“free from 
                pathogens and elevated levels of harmful substances”</a>.
                We believe that “safe” drinking water should not justbe in the short term 
                but also in the long term. But taking this approach requires a fairly detailed
                understanding of water quality. So before we get into that, we will look briefly into current water supplies in developing countries.

                Many people get their water from wells and springs in developing countries. The wealthier populations

                Asia have made drinking boiled water a tradition, especially when it comes with tea drinking. However, 
                boiling water does not actually remove other harmful substances from the water, unless distilled; it just 
                increases the concentration of these substances.

                Wealthier populations may use bottled water as their source of liquids. While many bottling companies 
                are large and reputable, there is uncertainty to whether all of them conform to their national standards

            <p class = "info">
                After all these different options, reverse osmosis (RO) point-of-use systems seem to be heralded as solution for the water drinking problem. 
                It works by pushing water through a membrane that removes salts and other contaminants, leaving fairly pure water.

                However, this also takes out the mineral content causing the water to become highly aggressive, easily dissolving materials it comes into contact with.
                Treatment plants would remineralise the water to stop it from leaching piping materials back into the water. But this has effects on health. 
            </p>
            <p class = "info">
                The World Health Organisation have found that higher levels of calcium, and magnesium have correlated with 
                <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientsindw.pdf">lower levels of cardiovascular disease</a>. Demineralised 
                water was found to also <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">leach electrolytes from tissues and cause a whole range of health problems</a>. 
                While the WHO focuses on the role of calcium and magnesium, other important minerals are stripped away such as fluorides 
                that have beneficial effects on dental health. The interesting thing was that effects such as "increased cardiovascular 
                disorders, tiredness, weakness [and] muscular cramps” were <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">reported</a> only after a few months Czech and Slovak populations 
                started using reverse osmosis systems in their homes in 2002. 
                While diet could potentially provide the required nutrients, the modern diet is often deficient of the right amount 
                of nutrients. Micronutrients found in water are also in free ion form, which are better absorbed than if it were consumed as food. 
                While some RO POU purifiers add a calcium remineralization cartridge at the end-point, often this is only to 
                reduce the aggressive nature of the water. Other essential minerals are not re-added.

                RO membranes also faces a structural problem in that their membranes are susceptible to bacteria growth (biofouling) 
                and prone to leakages. This requires that they need to replaced very regularly to maintain their stated water quality 
                statistics. Not only this, but waste water is upwards of 90% with RO purifiers leading to

                The technology that we are producing can overcome the challenges of RO purifiers especially in terms of nutrients in water, 
                cost and quality over time. While for obvious reasons, we will not be going into the specifics of our technology, we can 
                say that we utilise multi-stage media filters without membranes and as of writing there exists no other technology similar to us. Unlike other 
                companies, we have a policy for transparency of results, and will show the results from an independent qualifications company.

                While we are initially targeting the wealthier demographics of developing countries, we hope to eventually treat water for 
                people in rural communities where funds are not plentiful, and oversight and management even less so. But water is an extremely 
                difficult problem, as we have stressed in this post, and those solutions may take even more creative solutions.
