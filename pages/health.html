                        More expensive machines will also add an additional UV light to kill the bacteria in the system. Despite this, many households in South East Asia will
                        further boil their water to kill off any remaining micro-organisms in the water.</p>

                    <h2 class = "subtitle"> The Problems with Reverse Osmosis</h2>
                    <p class = "info">The <i>World Health Organisation</i> published a report on the 'Health Risks from Drinking Demineralised Water' by Frantisek Kozisek 
                        that outlines several issues with drinking water treated by reverse osmosis.</p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                        <li>Demineralised water is highly aggressive, and if untreated in a desalination plant, will lead to leaching of metals and other materials in the piping distribution network.</li>
                        <li>Due to its aggressiveness, "it leads to the dilution of the electrolytes dissolved in the body water" which can lead to "tiredness, weakness and heache; more severe symptoms are muscular cramps and impaired heart rate".</li>
                        <li>It was found in an animal study of zinc and magnesium absorption from Robbins and Sly, that higher mineral intake from food did not lead to higher absorption in the body.</li>
                        <li>Little or no intake of calcium and magnesium from low-mineral water which can lead to higher levels of cardiovascular disease. The effects can begin within a few months of consuming low mineral water as seen from epidemiological evidence from "Czech and Slovak populations who began using reverse osmosis-based systems for final treatment of drinking water at their home taps in 2000-2002."</li>
                        <li>Low intake of essential elements and microelements from low-mineral water especially if diets are already deficient in the nutrients.</li>
                        <li>If low-mineral water is used in preparing food, there is greater losses of nutrients in the food consumed.</li>
                        <li>Finally, unless RO membranes are replaced regularly, bacterial growth on the filters and leakages can lead to consumption of pathogens in drinking water</li>
                        <li>Many RO companies knowing the aggressive nature and effects of low mineral water will have a remineralization cartridge as an add-on for the system, but these cartridges only contain several of the major minerals such as limestone (calcium) and will be mineral-deficient in other elements such as potassium or magnesium or the other micronutrients. The remineralization cartridges will also not dissolve enough of the minerals back into the water fit for human consumption.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class = "subtitle"> Mineral Balanced Water</h2>
                    <p class = "info"> Our machine uses a combination of activated carbon, sediment, and ultrafiltration filters and UV rays to achieve World Health Organisation standards. Because we do not rely on an Reverse Osmosis system to remove contaminants, we do not need to use remineralization cartridges our water to add minerals back into the system. Our POUs balances the minerals in water and if levels are too high, brings it down to the WHO standards, but will not lead to mineral deficiency provided that the input water has not been desalinated.</p>
