                Quality drinking water is an oft-misunderstood concept. When it exists, it is unappreciated,
                and when it doesn’t, you panic. But in the middle of this spectrum is the fact that children
                and those with immune deficiency often get very sick from drinking contaminated water. At Nature’s Way
                we believe that “safe” healthy drinking water should be easily accessible.

                    Wealthier populations may use bottled water as their source of liquids. While many bottling

                    are large and reputable, there is uncertainty to whether all of them conform to producing Healthy

                    Generally bottled water is expensive compared to alternative sources. The bottles often contain
                    unwanted microplastics
                    and are a serious International Environmental problem.

                    In the past Reverse osmosis (RO) point-of-use systems seemed to be a solution for the water drinking
                    problem.
                    It works by pushing water through a membrane that removes salts and other contaminants, leaving
                    fairly pure water.

                    However, this process removes vital mineral content necessary to maintain the Human Health and
                    causes the water to
                    become highly aggressive, easily dissolving materials it comes into contact with. Treatment plants
                    would remineralise
                    the water to stop it from leaching piping materials back into the water. But this also has effects
                    on health.

                    The World Health Organisation have found that higher levels of calcium, and magnesium have
                    correlated with
                    <a href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientsindw.pdf">lower levels of
                        cardiovascular disease</a>. Demineralised
                    water was found to also <a
                        href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">leach electrolytes
                        from tissues and cause a whole range of health problems</a>.
                    While the WHO focuses on the role of calcium and magnesium, other important minerals are stripped
                    away such as fluorides
                    that have beneficial effects on dental health. The interesting thing was that effects such as
                    "increased cardiovascular
                    disorders, tiredness, weakness [and] muscular cramps” were <a
                        href="http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">reported</a> only
                    after a few months.
                    While diet could potentially provide the required nutrients, the modern diet is often deficient of
                    the right amount
                    of nutrients. Micronutrients found in water are also in free ion form, which are better absorbed
                    than if it were consumed as food.
                    Some RO POU purifiers add a calcium remineralization cartridge at the end-point, often this is only
                    to
                    reduce the aggressive nature of the water. Other essential minerals are not re-added.

                    RO membranes also faces a structural problem in that their membranes are susceptible to bacteria
                    growth (biofouling)
                    and prone to leakages. This requires that they need to replaced very regularly to briefly
                    re-establish their stated water quality.
