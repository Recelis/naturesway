                    Quality drinking water is an oft-misunderstood concept. When it exists, it is unappreciated, 
                    and when it doesn’t, you panic. But in the middle of this spectrum is the fact that children 
                    and those with immune deficiency often get very sick from drinking contaminated water. At Nature’s Way 
                    we believe that “safe” healthy drinking water should be easily accessible.

                    Boiling Water is not always effective for the inactivation of <a href = "http://www.ehproject.org/PDF/ehkm/boiling2009.pdf">“bacteria, viruses and protozoa”</a>.  
                    Boiling water does not remove other harmful substances from the water; such as Arsenic, Lead, Manganese, Fluoride, Pesticides and Chemicals.

            <p class = "info">
                Wealthier populations may use bottled water as their source of liquids. While many bottling companies 
                are large and reputable, there is uncertainty to whether all of them conform to producing Healthy drinking water. 
                Generally bottled water is expensive compared to alternative sources. The bottles often contain unwanted microplastics 
                and are a serious International Environmental problem.

                Reverse Osmosis

            <p class = "info">
                    In the past Reverse osmosis (RO) point-of-use systems seemed to be a solution for the water drinking problem. 
                    It works by pushing water through a membrane that removes salts and other contaminants, leaving fairly pure water.

                However, this process removes vital mineral content necessary to maintain the Human Health and causes the water to 
                become highly aggressive, easily dissolving materials it comes into contact with. Treatment plants would remineralise 
                the water to stop it from leaching piping materials back into the water. But this also has effects on health.

                The World Health Organisation have found that higher levels of calcium, and magnesium have correlated with 
                <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientsindw.pdf">lower levels of cardiovascular disease</a>. Demineralised 
                water was found to also <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">leach electrolytes from tissues and cause a whole range of health problems</a>. 
                While the WHO focuses on the role of calcium and magnesium, other important minerals are stripped away such as fluorides 
                that have beneficial effects on dental health. The interesting thing was that effects such as "increased cardiovascular 
                disorders, tiredness, weakness [and] muscular cramps” were <a href = "http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf">reported</a> only after a few months. 
                While diet could potentially provide the required nutrients, the modern diet is often deficient of the right amount 
                of nutrients. Micronutrients found in water are also in free ion form, which are better absorbed than if it were consumed as food. 
                Some RO POU purifiers add a calcium remineralization cartridge at the end-point, often this is only to 
                reduce the aggressive nature of the water. Other essential minerals are not re-added.

            <p class = "info">
                RO membranes also faces a structural problem in that their membranes are susceptible to bacteria growth (biofouling) 
                and prone to leakages. This requires that they need to replaced very regularly to briefly re-establish their stated water quality.

                    The technology that we provide can overcome the challenges of RO purifiers especially in terms of nutrients in water, 
                    cost and quality over time. While for obvious reasons, we will not be going into the specifics of our technology, we 
                    can say that we utilise multi-stage media filters without membranes and as of writing there exists no other technology 
                    similar to us. Unlike other companies, we have a policy for transparency of results, and will show the results from an 
                    independent qualifications company.
