                <p class = "info">Nature’s Way Water Technologies has found an international partner in the North Eastern University to help deliver our POUs to the Chinese market. Robert Sschultz and Jacky Lui travelled to the university in March this year 2018 to help train and teach the university on the benefits of mineral balanced water and on our Family and Grande sized machines.</p>

                <p class = "info"> When demonstrating the worth of a machine, the only thing that matters is hard scientific data. Even though we have SGS validation on the quality of our mineral balanced water in Australia, North Eastern University has performed tests on our water in Shenyang, China to verify for themselves that it works.</p>

                <p class = "info"> We will be working with North Eastern University to find better solutions to the water quality problem in the world. By testing and fine-tuning our machines to specific geographical needs, we will ensure that our machines will optimise the right amount of minerals entering into people’s bodies. </p>

                <p class = "info"> Our goal is to take our POUs global to ensure that every person in the world has access to clean mineral balanced water. If you fear that your water is undrinkable and your only treatments are through Reverse Osmosis, then contact us and we will work with you to ensure that you water is both clean and healthy.</p>
