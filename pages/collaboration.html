Robert Sschultz and Jacky Lui travelled to the university in March this year 2018 to help train and teach the university on the benefits of mineral balanced water and on our Family and Grande sized machines.</p>

Even though we have SGS validation on the quality of our mineral balanced water in Australia, North Eastern University has performed tests on our water in Shenyang, China to verify for themselves that it works.</p>
